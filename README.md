# AutoEncoding-Anomalies
Evaluation of autoencoders and other deep learning methods for Anomaly detection (on sequential data)

This project aims streamlining the development of deep learning models in a controlled manner.
Configurations of various types are saved during training and testing to ensure proper logging of changes.
Basic configuration files allows for rapid iterations.

This project relies on other modules developed for it (on this github) : custom_tf_models, datasets, modaliies, CustomKerasLayers, and misc_utils.

This project was realised during my PhD Thesis, which was founded by the UBS (Université de Bretagne Sud) and the DGA (Direction Générale de l'Armement).
